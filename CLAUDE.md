# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Obsidian Financial is a full-stack TypeScript application with two halves living in one repo:

- **Frontend** (`src/`): React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4. Currently a shell — `main.tsx` is the entry, `landing page.tsx` is a placeholder. `features/`, `hooks/`, `tests/` directories exist but are empty.
- **Backend** (`node/src/`): Express 5 API server, mounted at `/api/v1`. Talks to a Supabase-hosted Postgres over the `pg` driver (no ORM — raw SQL in repository files).

The two halves use different `tsconfig` files (`tsconfig.app.json` for the client, `tsconfig.server.json` for the server, `rootDir: ./node`, `outDir: ./node/dist`).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Vite dev server (frontend, native)
npm run server       # Backend with nodemon + tsx (hot reload, runs node/src/server.ts)
npm run build        # tsc -b && vite build (frontend production build)
npm run build:server # Compile backend to node/dist/
npm run lint         # ESLint over the repo
npm test             # Vitest (single run, integration tests against local Postgres)

# Containerized dev stack
npm run dev:up       # supabase start + docker compose dev up (backend + frontend, hot reload)
npm run dev:down     # docker compose dev down + supabase stop
npm run test:docker  # Run vitest inside the test container against .env.test
```

Run a single test file: `npx vitest run node/src/tests/repository/userRepository.test.ts`

The test runner is configured with named projects in `vitest.config.ts` — to run one project: `npx vitest run --project users` (or `accounts`, `groups`, `transactions`, `refreshTokens`, `plaidSync`, `accountTransactions`, `refreshService`). Each project maps to exactly one test file via its `include` glob, so a new test file needs a new project entry to be picked up.

## Environment files

`.gitignore` excludes all `.env*` files.

| File | Purpose | Loaded by |
|---|---|---|
| `.env.dev` | Backend dev runtime (DB, JWT secrets, SMTP, Plaid creds). | `config/database.ts` (native) + `docker-compose.dev.yaml` (containerized) |
| `.env.test` | Test DB + JWT secrets. `supabase` must be a full PG URL (`postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/obsidian_test`). `PLAID_ENV=sandbox` + real sandbox creds needed only for `seedPlaidItem` tests. | `vitest.config.ts`, container `test` service |
| `.env.docker.prod` | Prod container runtime. | `docker-compose.prod.yaml` |

> **Leave the DB/SMTP host on `127.0.0.1` — do not "fix" it.** Native runs need loopback (Docker Desktop publishes Supabase's ports there); the containerized stack can't use loopback, so `docker-compose.dev.yaml` overrides just those two vars to `host.docker.internal` via `environment:` on the `backend`/`test` services. One set of files serves both modes. Pointing a *native* run at `host.docker.internal` makes `database.ts` time out and `server.ts` `process.exit(1)` on startup.

Required Plaid env vars (backend throws at startup if missing): `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SANDBOX_SECRET` (swap `PLAID_PRODUCTION_SECRET` in prod), and `PLAID_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte hex; rotating it requires re-encrypting all `plaid_items` rows, and `.env.test` should use a different value).

## Dev environments

Pick one per session — **don't run both at once** (port conflicts):

- **Native:** `npx supabase start` (once), then `npm run server` (backend) and `npm run dev` (frontend). Fast, IDE-debuggable.
- **Containerized:** `npm run dev:up` — Supabase via CLI plus `backend` (port 3000) and `frontend` (port 5173) containers, both hot-reloading over bind-mounted source (polling-based watch for Windows). The Vite proxy targets `http://backend:3000` via `VITE_PROXY_TARGET`. `npm run test:docker` runs vitest in the on-demand `test` service.

## Backend Architecture

Layered request flow: **routes → middleware → services → repositories → pg Pool**.

- `node/src/app.ts` — Express app: JSON + cookie-parser middleware, mounts `/api/v1`, has a single terminal error handler that special-cases `AppError` subclasses (returns `statusCode`, `errorCode`, `message`, `details`, `timestamp`) and falls back to `INTERNAL_ERROR` 500 for anything else.
- `node/src/server.ts` — entry point: calls `pool.connect()` to verify DB, listens on `PORT` (default 3000), wires `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` to a graceful shutdown that closes `pool` and forces exit after 10s.
- `node/src/routes/V1/index.ts` — single router for all v1 endpoints. Public routes: `register`, `login`, `logout`, `password-reset`. Authenticated: `users`, `transactions`, `groups`, `accounts`, `invitations`, `plaid`. Admin: `admin`.
- `node/src/middleware/` — `validate` (Zod schema validation), `authenticate` (see auth flow below), `authorizeAdmin`/`authorizeCreator`/`authorizeMember` (role gates), `attachFreshToken`.
- `node/src/services/` — business logic. `services/auth/` contains `loginService`, `logoutService`, `registrationService`, `refreshService`, `passwordResetService`.
- `node/src/repository/` — all SQL lives here. One file per table/aggregate. Repositories use the shared `pool` from `config/database.ts`.
- `node/src/schemas/` — Zod request schemas, consumed by the `validate` middleware.
- `node/src/errors/` — custom `AppError` hierarchy: `AuthenticationError`, `AuthorizationError`, `ConflictError`, `DatabaseError`, `ExternalServiceError`, `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`. Always throw these (not raw `Error`) so the central handler can format the response.

### Auth flow (important)

Cookie-based JWTs, not Authorization headers:

- **Access token**: 15-min HS256 JWT, `req.cookies.access_token` (with optional `Bearer ` prefix). Payload is `{ userId, groupId, role }` — `groupId`/`role` come from the user's active `group_memberships` row.
- **Refresh token**: 7-day JWT, `req.cookies.refreshToken`. Stored server-side as a SHA-256 hash in `refresh_tokens` (see `utils/hashing.ts`, `repository/refreshTokenRepository.ts`), with a `last_used_at` column tracking activity.
- The `authenticate` middleware does **silent refresh**: on `TokenExpiredError` for the access token, it pulls the refresh cookie, calls `refreshTokens()`, sets a new access-token cookie, and continues. **Silent refresh does not rotate the refresh token** — rotating on every refresh raced concurrent requests carrying the same expired-access cookie (the first revoked the token out from under the second, forcing a re-login). Instead the same refresh token is kept; `touchRefreshToken` bumps `last_used_at` and slides the 7-day expiry, so an actively-used session survives. The refresh token is still rotated at login/logout/password-change.
- **Activity is bumped on every authenticated request, not just on silent refresh.** Even when the access token is still valid, `authenticate` calls `recordRefreshTokenActivity()` (best-effort — it swallows errors so an activity-write failure can't 500 an otherwise-valid request), which slides `last_used_at` and the expiry. So `last_used_at` reflects real request activity, and the 30-min inactivity limit in `refreshService.ts` (`INACTIVITY_LIMIT_MS`) is measured from the last *request*. If exceeded on the next refresh, all of the user's refresh tokens are revoked.
- **Client-side idle auto-logout**: "activity" is purely an authenticated HTTP request — there's no DOM/heartbeat tracking, and the dashboard doesn't poll. To avoid stranding a logged-in-looking page after the session dies server-side, `src/lib/api.ts` drives a timer (via `setSessionListeners`) that resets on every successful request and, after `INACTIVITY_LIMIT_MS` idle, proactively logs out (revoking server-side) and redirects to login. Any `401` also triggers the redirect. The client constant must stay in sync with the server's `INACTIVITY_LIMIT_MS`.
- Passwords are hashed with **argon2**. Tokens (refresh + invitation + password-reset) are hashed with SHA-256 before storage.
- Required env vars (`utils/jwt.ts` throws on import if missing): `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`. Connection string env var is `supabase` (lowercase — `config/database.ts`).

### Express 5 conventions

This project is on Express 5, so async route handlers do not need `try/catch` — thrown errors propagate to the error middleware automatically. Don't add wrapper utilities or try/catch boilerplate in route handlers.

## Database

Schema is managed via Supabase CLI migrations in `supabase/migrations/` (timestamped `.sql` files, applied in lexicographic order). Core tables:

- `users`, `groups`, `group_memberships` (a user can belong to one active group at a time — `findActiveMembership` filters by `departed_at IS NULL`)
- `accounts`, `account_members`, `account_group_visibility`, `account_transactions`, `transactions` (Plaid-shaped)
- `plaid_items` — one row per linked bank institution per user. Stores the AES-256-GCM encrypted Plaid access token across three columns (`access_token_ciphertext`, `access_token_iv`, `access_token_tag`) and the `/transactions/sync` cursor in `transactions_cursor`.
- `invitations`, `password_reset_tokens`, `refresh_tokens`, `audit_log`
- RLS is enabled on most tables (`20251223001447_blanket_RLS.sql`, `20260421005059_enable_rls_refresh_tokens_audit_log.sql`)
- A trigger revokes all refresh tokens on password change (`20260423110202_revoke_sessions_on_password_change.sql`)

### Notable column conventions

- `accounts.type` / `accounts.subtype` — Plaid's native account taxonomy stored verbatim. `type` is one of Plaid's 4 top-level types (`"depository" | "credit" | "loan" | "investment"`), enforced by the `valid_account_type` CHECK. `subtype` is Plaid's subtype (e.g. `"checking"`, `"credit card"`, `"401k"`) and is intentionally free-form (no DB CHECK) so a newly-added Plaid subtype never breaks an insert. `node/src/services/plaid/subtypeMap.ts` is the single source of truth for the taxonomy: it exports `ACCOUNT_TYPES` / `ACCOUNT_SUBTYPES` (consumed by both the Plaid sync path and the Zod `createAccountSchema`) and `sanitizePlaidAccountType()`, which normalizes Plaid's `type`/`subtype` and returns `null` for an unsupported top-level type (e.g. `"other"`) so the caller skips that account.
- `transactions.amount` — stored as **positive = inflow** (income, deposits, refunds), **negative = outflow** (purchases, withdrawals). Plaid returns the opposite sign (positive = outflow), so the sync service flips the sign at insert and on every `modified` update. Manual transactions entered by the user should use the natural personal-finance sign (no flip).
- `transactions.pending` — `true` while a transaction is still pending at the bank. Plaid's `modified` array drives the `pending=true → false` transition when a transaction posts. `account_transactions.transaction_type` (`"debit"` / `"credit"`) is derived from the stored (post-flip) amount sign.

## Testing

Integration tests run against a real local Postgres (Supabase CLI's bundled instance) — start it with `npx supabase start`. Native runs use `npm test`; containerized runs use `npm run test:docker` (same `127.0.0.1` → `host.docker.internal` override as the backend, see Environment files).

`vitest.config.ts` calls `dotenv.config({ path: ".env.test" })` at the top of the file — this must happen before any module imports because `database.ts` creates its pool at import time. The connection string and `NODE_ENV=test` come from `.env.test`.

`node/src/tests/globalSetup.ts` derives the admin connection (for the `postgres` superuser DB) from the test URL and drops/recreates the `obsidian_test` database from `supabase/migrations/*.sql` on every run. Tests are configured with `fileParallelism: false` because all projects share one database — parallel TRUNCATE/INSERT would deadlock. Keep this in mind when adding new tests.

### Test helpers

`node/src/tests/helpers/dbHelper.ts` — `truncateAll`, `seedUser`, `seedGroup`, `seedAccount`, `seedTransaction`, `seedAccountMember`, `seedAccountTransaction`. Call `seedGroup(userId)` before `seedPlaidItem` — `exchangePublicToken` writes `account_group_visibility` rows that require a group FK.

`node/src/tests/helpers/plaidHelper.ts` — `seedPlaidItem(userId, groupId, options?)`. Makes real Plaid sandbox API calls: creates a sandbox public token, runs the full `exchangePublicToken` service (accounts + initial transaction sync), and retries sync with backoff if transactions aren't ready yet (~8–10s per call). Guard throws if `PLAID_ENV !== "sandbox"`.

### Notable test coverage

- **`refreshService.test.ts`** (project `refreshService`) — `recordRefreshTokenActivity`: slides `last_used_at`/`expires_at` forward for a valid token (passing the **raw** token, asserting it gets hashed before the row is touched), and is a no-op that neither throws nor creates a row for an unknown/garbage token (locking in the best-effort, never-500 contract).
- **`refreshTokenRepository.test.ts`** (project `refreshTokens`) — includes a `touchRefreshToken` case asserting `last_used_at` is bumped and `expires_at` slid without revoking the token.
- **`userRepository.test.ts`** (project `users`) — `updateUserName` cases: updates first/last and returns the row without `password_hash`, allows an empty last name (single-word display name), and returns `undefined` for a missing user.
- **`groupRepository.test.ts`** (project `groups`) — `updateGroupName` cases. (This file also imports `findGroupById`; a stale `findById` import here previously broke the whole `groups` project's compilation.)
- **`accountService.test.ts`** (project `accountTransactions`) — covers the manual account edit/delete service paths.

### Plaid integration test pattern

Use `beforeAll` (not `beforeEach`) to create one Plaid item per `describe` block — each `seedPlaidItem` call takes ~8–10s due to async sandbox processing. Share that item across read-only `it` cases. Tests that mutate state (deactivate, delete) belong in their own `describe` with `beforeEach(truncateAll)` + direct seeds.

`testTimeout` must be set inside each project entry in `vitest.config.ts` — root-level `testTimeout` is not inherited by project configs in vitest 4.x.

## Email

`node/src/config/email.ts` configures nodemailer. In dev/test it points at Supabase's bundled SMTP (port 54325, viewable via Mailpit). In production it requires `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_FROM`, and SMTP credentials, and uses `secure: true`.

## Deployment

`Dockerfile` is a multi-stage build that compiles **only** the backend (`npm run build:server`) into `node/dist`, copies it to `/usr/local/app/build`, and runs `node build/server.js`. The frontend isn't deployed via this Dockerfile. `docker-compose.prod.yaml` reads `.env.docker.prod` and exposes port 3000.

`Dockerfile.dev` and `Dockerfile.frontend.dev` are dev-only counterparts used by `docker-compose.dev.yaml` — they install all deps and run nodemon / vite respectively against bind-mounted source. Don't use them for production builds.

## Group Lifecycle

Every user always belongs to exactly one active group. The lifecycle rules are:

- **Registration** — `registrationService.ts` calls `createPersonalGroupForUser` immediately after creating the user row. The resulting group (`"<first_name>'s Household"`, `role='creator'`) is written into the access token JWT so the user has a valid `groupId` from the very first request.
- **Invite accept** — `acceptInvitationAndJoinGroup` (in `invitationRepository.ts`) runs in one transaction: it locks the accepter's membership row, verifies their current group has only them as a member and they are the `creator`, soft-departs the membership, hard-deletes the auto-group (CASCADE cleans up `account_group_visibility`), and inserts a new `group_memberships` row in the inviter's group. The accepter's accounts survive (they remain in `account_members`) but are **not** automatically shared into the new household — visibility must be explicitly granted.
- **Leave / Kick / Group delete** — all three paths call `unlinkUserAccountsFromGroup` to remove the departing user's accounts from the household's visibility, then call `createPersonalGroupForUser` to restore solo state. `createPersonalGroupForUser` creates the group + membership and re-inserts `account_group_visibility` rows for every account the user owns, so their accounts are immediately visible in their restored personal group.
- **Stale JWTs after kick** — a kicked user's access token is valid for up to 15 min with a stale `groupId`. This self-corrects on the next silent refresh because `refreshService.ts` re-queries `findActiveMembership`.

`createPersonalGroupForUser` in `groupRepository.ts` is the single source of truth for the solo state — call it wherever solo state needs to be restored; don't duplicate the group+membership+visibility logic inline.

## Account Visibility

`account_group_visibility` controls which accounts a group can see on the dashboard. Key rules:

- Linking a bank via Plaid writes visibility rows only for the user's **own current group** (their personal household at link time).
- Joining a new household via invite does **not** auto-share the joining user's accounts — the CASCADE delete of their old auto-group removes the old visibility rows, and no new ones are inserted for the new group.
- Users explicitly share/unshare accounts with their group via `POST /api/v1/accounts/:id/share` and `DELETE /api/v1/accounts/:id/share`. Only an `owner` or `joint` `account_members` row grants permission to change visibility.
- Repository functions: `accountRepository.shareAccountWithGroup` and `accountRepository.unshareAccountFromGroup`.

## Plaid Integration

Files under `node/src/services/plaid/` and `node/src/routes/V1/plaidRoutes.ts` implement the bank-linking flow.

### Link flow (one bank)

1. `POST /api/v1/plaid/link-token` → `linkTokenService.createLinkToken(userId)` — calls Plaid `/link/token/create` and returns a short-lived `link_token` to the frontend.
2. Frontend opens Plaid Link (via `react-plaid-link`). On success it receives a one-time `public_token`.
3. `POST /api/v1/plaid/exchange-token` → `itemService.exchangePublicToken(userId, groupId, publicToken)`:
   - Exchanges `public_token` for a long-lived `access_token` + `item_id`.
   - Fetches accounts (with balances, names, mask) and institution name.
   - AES-256-GCM encrypts the `access_token` via `node/src/utils/plaidCrypto.ts`.
   - In one Postgres transaction: inserts `plaid_items`, inserts `accounts` (with Plaid's `type`/`subtype` taxonomy, normalized via `sanitizePlaidAccountType`), inserts `account_members` (`ownership_type='owner'`), inserts `account_group_visibility` for the user's current group.
   - Outside that transaction, calls `syncTransactions` to pull the last 30 days of transactions.
4. Multi-bank: the frontend re-mints a fresh `link_token` (step 1) for each additional institution so Plaid Link can be re-opened. Each successful exchange runs step 3 independently.

### Transaction sync

`node/src/services/plaid/transactionsSyncService.ts` — `syncTransactions(plaidItemRowId, accessToken, userId, startCursor?)`:
- Loops `/transactions/sync` until `has_more=false`, accumulating `added`, `modified`, `removed`.
- **added**: INSERT into `transactions` + `account_transactions`. `ON CONFLICT (plaid_id) DO NOTHING` makes retries idempotent.
- **modified**: UPDATE the existing row (handles pending → posted transitions and amount/date corrections).
- **removed**: DELETE by `plaid_id` (CASCADE removes `account_transactions` rows).
- Saves the final `next_cursor` to `plaid_items.transactions_cursor` after a successful commit, so the next sync call picks up only new deltas.
- The cursor is `null` on first sync — Plaid returns all available history (typically ~24 months) and the 30-day window is enforced by Plaid's sandbox default, not by this code.

### Encryption (`node/src/utils/plaidCrypto.ts`)

- `encryptToken(plaintext)` → `{ ciphertext, iv, tag }` — all base64. Uses a fresh 12-byte random IV per call.
- `decryptToken({ ciphertext, iv, tag })` → plaintext string.
- Key is read from `PLAID_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte hex). The module throws at import if the key is missing or wrong length — this is intentional (fail fast on misconfiguration).
- Rotating the key requires a migration that re-encrypts all rows with the new key before the old key is removed from env.
